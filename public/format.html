    1.the given style must not exceed the scope of the section, for example styling the body
    2.remember the styles and js that are uploaded to the website will be 1 in 1 file so you can make this section have 1 main style
    3.Even if you don't set the section height to 100vh, in the preview later each section will fill the screen (full screen) and if the tag exceeds that, it will be removed.
    4.(bug / error) convetti animation or animation like that will apply to all section
    5.adding local files, both images and videos, must be placed in the root folder, must not be branched
    6.when publishing only the section is up
    7.make this section like a body if you give padding , border or margin it will have an effect on the slide and it is not recommended
